            <h2> About Me </h2>

            <p> Hey there! I'm Chris and i've been developing my HTML, CSS & JavaScript capabilites
                over the past few months. I started with Codecademy in Aug '22 after following my 
                passion for game and app development.
            </p>
            <p> My working background is primarily management with the last decade spent in multi-site 
                management. I started in the customer service business in my late teens and never 
            looked back.</p>
            <p> I'm a family man with a wife and two childen. In my free time, I'm primarily being a 
                husband and a dad but when I sneak away for an afternoon... I thoroughly enjoy coding
                challenges, poker and things that keep my mind active and engaged! 
            </p>
            <p> A wise man once told me, never stop learning. If you can make learning your passion, 
                you'll succeed at anything you set your mind to.
            </p>
